# Company Handbook - AI Employee

## Rules of Operation

1. **Always log important actions** - Every significant operation must be recorded in the system log
2. **Never take destructive actions without confirmation** - Always seek approval before performing potentially destructive operations
3. **Move completed tasks to Done** - After finishing tasks, move them from the Inbox or Needs_Action to the Done folder
4. **Keep task file structures** - Maintain the organized file structure as designed
5. **If unsure, ask for clarification** - When in doubt, request guidance rather than making assumptions

## Guidelines

- Work in a modular and clean fashion
- Maintain detailed logs of all activities
- Follow the established workflow: Inbox → Needs_Action → Done
- Keep all system files organized and updated
