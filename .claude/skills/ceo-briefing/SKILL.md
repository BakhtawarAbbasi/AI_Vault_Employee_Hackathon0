## Error Handling

The skill handles common errors gracefully:

- Corrupted log files (skips and logs error)
- Email sending failures (saves report locally)
- Date parsing errors (uses current week)

All errors are logged to business.log with details.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Weekly** - Check briefing every Monday morning

3. **Track Trends** - Monitor week-over-week changes
4. **Archive Reports** - Keep historical records for analysis
5. **Customize Metrics** - Adjust tracked metrics to your needs

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No data in report

**Solution:** Ensure all source files exist and contain data
```bash
ls -la AI_Employee_Vault/Done/
ls -la AI_Employee_Vault/Accounting/
tail AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/business.log
```

### Issue: Email not sending

**Solution:** Check email configuration
```bash
echo $EMAIL_ADDRESS
echo $CEO_EMAIL
python scripts/send_email.py test@example.com "Test" "Body"
```

### Issue: Wrong week range

**Solution:** Set correct week start day
```bash
export CEO_BRIEFING_WEEK_START=1  # Monday
```
